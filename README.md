Simple Shell Group project
Shell is a an ALX Group Project; whereby students are tasked to create a shell program called hsh; whereby the user can be able to input text-based commands, which the shell interprets and executes.

All files that were created in this project were compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.

the compilation for the shell program is gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh.
